# Web Scrapping - Beautiful Soup

Technology used: *python, beautiful soup, pandas*


I just found a good data source of restaurants in Berlin. I decided to use Beautiful Soup to try to extract data and create a dataset with all restaurants in Berlin.

## Python file

The whole web scrapping process was performed using Beautiful Soup library [*collecting_data.py*](https://github.com/lucjankonopka/web_scrapping/blob/main/collecting_data.py).

The process is also included in the jupyter notebook file [*web_scrapping_restaurants_in_berlin.ipynb*](https://github.com/lucjankonopka/web_scrapping/blob/main/web_scrapping_restaurants_in_berlin.ipynb).

## Output

Output file in form dataset as .csv file [*dataset_berlin_restaurants.csv*](https://github.com/lucjankonopka/web_scrapping/blob/main/dataset_berlin_restaurants.csv).

The new created dataset was used to further analysis. 

## Visualisation

The gathered data was used to create an [*interactive map of restaurants in Berlin*](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/lucjan.konopka/viz/RestaurantsinBerlin/RestaurantsinBerlin) in Tableau Public.
